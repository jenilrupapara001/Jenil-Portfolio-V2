## The Transition from Builder to Leader

When a SaaS company scales, the role of the Lead Engineer shifts. You stop being the "Fastest Coder" and start being the "Force Multiplier." This transition is the hardest part of a technical career. Here are my key lessons from the frontlines of engineering leadership.

## 1. Delegate 'What', Not 'How'

As a leader, you define the **Target**. "We need to reduce API latency by 30%." You allow your team to define the **Path**. This builds ownership and trust. If you micro-manage the "How," you become a bottleneck and your team becomes a group of "Ticket Takers."

## 2. Champion the 'No'

The most important job of an engineering leader is protecting the team's focus. 
Every week, 10 new feature ideas will arrive from Sales or Marketing. Your job is to say "No" to the 9 that will derail the core product and say "Yes" to the 1 that will move the needle. **Focus is the secret to velocity.**

## 3. Build a Culture of 'Radical Candor'

High-performing teams don't avoid conflict; they embrace it. Use **Blame-free Post-mortems**. When a server goes down, the question isn't "Whose fault was this?". The question is "What part of our process allowed this to happen, and how do we fix the process?".

## 4. Technical Debt as a Financial Tool

Think like a CFO. Technical debt is a "Loan." Sometimes you take out a loan to move fast (e.g., skip a test to hit a launch date). But like any loan, it has **Interest**. If you don't pay it back, the interest will eventually eat all your feature-building capacity.

## 5. Hire for Slope, Not Intercept

Don't just hire someone who knows "Framework X" today. Hire people who have a high **Learning Rate**. In SaaS, what we use today will be obsolete in 3 years. You need engineers who are self-drivers, curious, and excited by the challenge of constant change.

## Conclusion

Engineering leadership is about building a system of people that is as resilient and scalable as your systems of code. By focusing on delegation, focus, and culture, you create an environment where world-class talent can do the best work of their lives.
