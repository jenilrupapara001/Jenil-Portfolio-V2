## The Forgotten Frontend

The most critical part of your SaaS isn't just what your users see; it's what your *team* sees. An **Admin Panel**—the 'Cockpit' of your business—is what allows you to support users, manage billing, and debug system health. Yet, it's often the most neglected part of the codebase.

## 1. Separation of Concerns: The Dual-App Approach

Don't bundle your Admin Panel inside your main user application.
- **Pros**: Security (totally separate auth domain), faster build times for the main app, different tech stacks (e.g., more 'functional' UI for admin, more 'cinematic' for users).
- **Cons**: You have to manage two deployments.
I recommend a **Monorepo** approach (Turborepo/Nx) where the admin and user apps share the same core types and API clients but remain separate UI projects.

## 2. Role-Based Admin Access

Just because someone works at the company doesn't mean they should see everything.
- **Support Staff**: Can see user details but not credit card info.
- **Sales**: Can see billing but not change tech settings.
- **Developers**: Full access (but always with an **Audit Log**).

## 3. Performance for Large Lists

Admin panels often deal with thousands of rows. Use **Server-side Pagination and Sorting** from Day 1. Libraries like `TanStack Table` are perfect for building high-performance, filterable tables that can handle millions of records without lagging.

## 4. Safety First: The 'Are You Sure?' Pattern

In an admin panel, one click can delete a user's company account. Implement a double-confirmation pattern: "Type the name of the company to confirm deletion." This 'Friction as a Feature' prevents catastrophic accidents from your support team.

## 5. Actionable Dashboard Metrics

An admin panel shouldn't just be 'Data'. It should be 'Action'. Instead of just showing a list of users, show "Users who haven't logged in for 30 days" or "Succeeded vs. Failed payments over time." Use **Chart.js or Tremor** to visualize the pulse of your business.

## Conclusion

A great admin panel is an investment in your company's velocity. By treating it with the same architectural rigor as your main product, you empower your team to provide world-class support and manage your scale with confidence.
