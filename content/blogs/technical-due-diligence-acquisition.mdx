## The Ultimate Milestone

The goal of many SaaS founders is an acquisition. But before the check is signed, the buyer will send a team of "Technical Auditors" to tear your codebase apart. This is **Technical Due Diligence (TDD)**. It can add or remove millions of dollars from your valuation.

## 1. IP and Legal Cleanliness

The auditor's first check is: "Do they own the code?".
- **Dependency Audit**: Ensure you aren't using "GPL" or other "Viral" licenses that might force you to open-source your product.
- **Contractor Agreements**: Verify that every developer who ever wrote a line of code has signed a "Work for Hire" agreement.

## 2. Code Quality and Maintainability

They will run static analysis tools (like SonarQube) to check for "Technical Debt," "Complexity Scores," and "Test Coverage." If your app is one giant 5,000-line file with zero tests, the buyer will see it as a liability that will require an expensive rewrite.

## 3. Scalability and Infrastructure Costs

They will look at your AWS bills for the last 12 months. Any "Inefficiency" (orphan instances, unoptimized DB queries, high bandwidth leakage) is a red flag. They want to see that your **Marginal Cost per User** is stable or declining as you scale.

## 4. Security Maturity

Expect a "Penetration Test." The auditors will try to break in. Having a history of regular security audits and a mature "Vulnerability Management" process is the best way to prove that you aren't selling them a "Security Time Bomb."

## 5. People and Process

Acquisitions are often about the team. They want to see:
- A clear **Deployment Pipeline**.
- Robust **Onboarding Documentation** for new engineers.
- A culture of **Code Review** and automated testing.

## Conclusion

Preparing for acquisition is the ultimate cleanup project. By treating your codebase and infrastructure as a "Financial Asset" rather than just a "Product," you ensure that when the opportunity for an exit arrives, you are ready to capture the maximum value of your hard work.
