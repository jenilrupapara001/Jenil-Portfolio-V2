## Deployment vs. Release

In the old world, when you deployed code, it was 'Live'. In the modern SaaS world, **Deployment** (moving code to a server) is a technical act, while **Release** (showing a feature to a user) is a business act. **Feature Flags** are the 'Toggle' that separates the two.

## 1. Why Use Feature Flags?

- **Canary Rollouts**: Enable a new feature for only 1% of users to check for bugs.
- **Beta Programs**: Invite specific 'VIP' users to test new workflows.
- **Instant Kill Switch**: If a new feature causes a crash, turn it off in 1 second without a red-deployment.
- **Trunk-Based Development**: Merge code into `main` every day, even if the feature isn't finished yet.

## 2. Choosing a Feature Flag Strategy

- **Static (Env Vars)**: Good for "Developer Modes" or "Maintenance Mode." Requires a restart to change.
- **Dynamic (Database/Redis)**: Good for "Admin Toggles." Changeable in real-time.
- **Managed (LaunchDarkly/PostHog)**: The professional choice. Handles user segments, targeting rules, and experimentation (A/B testing) out of the box.

## 3. Implementing Flags in the Frontend

In React/Next.js, I use a custom hook to protect components:

```javascript
const { isFeatureEnabled } = useFeatureFlags();

if (isFeatureEnabled('new-billing-ui')) {
  return <NewBillingPortal />;
}
return <OldBillingPortal />;
```

## 4. The Tech Debt Trap: Cleaning Up Flags

Feature flags are "Technical Debt" by design. An app with 1,000 flags is a maintenance nightmare. 
**The Rule**: Once a feature is at 100% rollout for 30 days, delete the flag and its conditional code from the project.

## 5. Flags as a Business Lever

Feature flags allow your product managers to control the site. They can turn on 'Black Friday Mode' or 'Maintenance Mode' without calling an engineer. This decoupling of 'Code' and 'Product' is what allows modern tech companies to move at lightning speed.

## Conclusion

Feature flags are the ultimate tool for risk management. They turn high-stakes releases into Boring events, allowing you to move fast, break things (privately), and fix them before anyone even notices.
