## The Traffic Cop of the Web

Your application is a hit. A single server can't handle the load. You spin up five more. But how do you ensure the traffic is distributed fairly? This is the job of the **Load Balancer**.

## 1. Layer 4 vs Layer 7 Load Balancing

- **Layer 4 (Transport)**: Routes based on IP and Port. Extremely fast but "blind" to the content of the request.
- **Layer 7 (Application)**: Industry standard for SaaS. It looks at HTTP headers, cookies, and URLs to make routing decisions.

## 2. Distribution Algorithms

Which server gets the next request?
- **Round Robin**: Sequential distribution. Simple but dangerous if servers have different capacities.
- **Least Connections**: Sends traffic to the server that is currently the least busy. The gold standard for web apps.
- **IP Hash**: Ensures a user with a specific IP always hits the same server. Vital if you haven't moved to stateless sessions yet.

## 3. Health Checks: Avoiding Dead Ends

A load balancer is only useful if it knows which servers are alive. I configure my balancers to check a specific `/health` endpoint every 10 seconds. If a server responds with a 5xx, it's automatically removed from the pool until it recovers.

## 4. SSL Termination

The load balancer should handle the SSL/TLS encryption. This offloads the heavy cryptographic work from your application servers, allowing them to focus 100% of their CPU on your Node.js logic.

## 5. Global Load Balancing (GSLB)

For global apps, you need a load balancer above your load balancers. GSLB uses Anycast DNS to route African users to an African data center and European users to a European one, minimizing latency before the user even hits your site.

## Conclusion

Load balancing is about balance and resilience. By choosing the right distribution strategy and implementing robust health checks, you create a system that can absorb traffic spikes and survive server failures with ease.
