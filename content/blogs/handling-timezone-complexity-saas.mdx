## The Timezone Trap

Every software developer has been burned by timezones. It's 10 PM on Sunday for your user in New York, but it's 3 AM on Monday for your server in London. How do you generate a "Weekly Report"? The answer is more complex than just "Use UTC."

## 1. Rule #1: Store in UTC, Display in Local

Always, without exception, store your timestamps in UTC (ISO 8601 format) in your database. This is your "Chronological Truth."

## 2. Rule #2: Storing the User's Intent

If a user schedules a meeting for 9 AM in Paris, don't just store the UTC equivalent. Paris might change its Daylight Savings rules. You must store:
1. The requested time.
2. The user's **IANA Timezone ID** (e.g., `Europe/Paris`).
This allows you to re-calculate the correct UTC time if the government changes the clock.

## 3. JavaScript Libraries: Day.js vs. Intl

Don't use the native `Date` object for complex math. Use **Day.js** (with the timezone plugin) or the modern **Intl.DateTimeFormat** API. These handle the edge cases of Daylight Savings and leap seconds that will otherwise break your business logic.

## 4. Timezones in SQL / NoSQL

In PostgreSQL, use the `TIMESTAMPTZ` type. In MongoDB, use the standard `Date` object. Both will normalize your data to UTC while preserving the precision needed for global aggregation.

## 5. Testing Your Logic

How do you know your "Yearly Summary" works for a user in Australia? You must **Mock the Timezone** in your unit tests. Test your logic across the extremes: UTC-12 (Baker Island) and UTC+14 (Line Islands).

## Conclusion

Time is relative in the world of global SaaS. By storing in UTC, preserving user timezone intent, and using modern libraries, you ensure that your application remains accurate and reliable, regardless of where on the planet your users are.
