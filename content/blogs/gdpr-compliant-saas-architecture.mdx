## Privacy by Design

If you want to serve users in Europe, GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) isn't optional—it's the law. Violations can cost millions. But GDPR isn't just a legal doc; it's an **Architectural Requirement**. 

## 1. Data Residency: Where Does the Data Live?

Many EU enterprises require their data to stay within the EEA (European Economic Area). This means you might need a multi-region setup:
- `app.yoursaas.com` (Global)
- `eu-db.yoursaas.com` (EU-specific RDS instance)

## 2. The Right to be Forgotten (Deletion)

GDPR states that a user can ask to have all their data deleted. 
**The Challenge**: Data is rarely in one table. It's in logs, backups, S3 buckets, and child tables. 
**The Solution**: Build a 'Deletion Engine' that cascades through your entire system, ensuring that when a user clicks 'Delete Account', every trace of them is scrubbed within 30 days.

## 3. Consent Management

Never assume 'Yes'. You must explicitly track consent for cookies, marketing emails, and data processing. Save the **Consent Timestamp** and the specific version of the Privacy Policy the user agreed to in your database.

## 4. Data Minimalization

The most secure data is the data you never collect. 
- Do you really need their phone number? 
- Do you really need to store their full IP address?
Scrub your database schemas. If a field isn't providing clear business value, delete it.

## 5. Breach Notification and Logs

GDPR requires you to notify users within 72 hours of a breach. To do this, you need **Observability**. You must be able to prove *what* was stolen and *whose* data it was. Secure, immutable audit logs are your only defense in the court of law.

## Conclusion

GDPR compliance is a badge of honor. It shows that you respect your users' privacy and that your architecture is built to professional, enterprise-grade standards. By building for privacy from Day 1, you open the door to the massive European market.
