## The Landscape of Web Threats

The OWASP Top 10 is the definitive list of the most critical security risks to web applications. For a Node.js developer, understanding these isn't just about compliance—it's about survival. Here is how I protect my applications against the current top threats.

## 1. Broken Access Control

The #1 risk. Ensure that users can only access data they are authorized to see.
- **The Fix**: Implement a centralized **Middleware-based RBAC** system. Never rely on the client sending a `userId` in the body; always extract the identity from a cryptographically signed JWT.

## 2. Cryptographic Failures

Sensitive data (Passwords, PII) must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **The Fix**: Use **Argon2** for passwords. Disable older TLS versions (v1.0, v1.1) in your Nginx config. Ensure all cookies are `Secure` and `HttpOnly`.

## 3. Injection (SQL, NoSQL, and Command)

Injection happens when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command.
- **The Fix**: Use **Prepared Statements** or **ORMs/ODMs** like Mongoose and Prisma. They automatically sanitize input, preventing attackers from 'escaping' the query string.

## 4. Insecure Design

Security must be part of the architecture, not an afterthought.
- **The Fix**: Implement **Threat Modeling** during the design phase. Limit the "Blast Radius" of a compromised service through microservice isolation and the Principle of Least Privilege.

## 5. Security Misconfiguration

Default credentials or open ports are an open invitation for hackers.
- **The Fix**: Automate your infrastructure with **Terraform**. Use security scanners like `Snyk` to find vulnerable dependencies and `Helmet.js` to set secure HTTP headers by default.

## Conclusion

Security is a continuous process, not a destination. By aligning your development practices with the OWASP framework, you build applications that are resilient, professional, and trusted by enterprise clients.
