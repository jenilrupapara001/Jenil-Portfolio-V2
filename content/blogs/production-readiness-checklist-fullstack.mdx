## The '90% Finished' Trap

Most developer projects are "90% finished" after 2 weeks. The last 10%—the **Production Readiness**—takes the other 90% of the time. Here is my final checklist for moving from "Development" to "Professional Production."

## 1. Global Error Handling and Tracking

- [ ] **Sentry Integration**: All frontend and backend errors are captured.
- [ ] **Custom 404/500 Pages**: No generic browser error pages.
- [ ] **Status Page**: A public-facing way for users to check system health.

## 2. Performance and Optimization

- [ ] **Lighthouse Baseline**: 90+ score on all metrics.
- [ ] **Asset Minification**: JS/CSS is compressed and fingerprinted.
- [ ] **Image Optimization**: WebP and correct sizing enforced.
- [ ] **Font Loading**: `font-display: swap` to prevent white-text flicker.

## 3. Security Hardening

- [ ] **Helmet.js Headers**: Secure headers set on the API.
- [ ] **Payload Limits**: No giant JSON bodies allowed.
- [ ] **No Console Logs**: All debug logs removed from production bundles.
- [ ] **CSRF/XSS Check**: Verified protection on all forms.

## 4. Database Integrity

- [ ] **Connection Pooling**: Configured for your anticipated concurrent load.
- [ ] **Backup Schedule**: Automated, daily, cross-region backups.
- [ ] **Indexing Audit**: Every query in the codebase targetting an indexed field.

## 5. Legal and Branding

- [ ] **Privacy Policy / ToS**: Live and accessible from the footer.
- [ ] **Social Meta Tags**: OpenGraph and Twitter images verified.
- [ ] **Favicon/Logo**: Consistent branding across all screen sizes.

## Conclusion

Production readiness is about "Removing the risk." By systematically checking these boxes, you ensure that your launch is a boring, successful event rather than a series of firefighting emergencies.
