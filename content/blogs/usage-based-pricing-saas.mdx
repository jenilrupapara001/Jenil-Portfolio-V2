## The Rise of Consumption Billing

Flat-rate subscriptions are easy to understand, but they often leave money on the table. **Usage-Based Pricing** (pioneered by AWS, Twilio, and Snowflake) ensures that your revenue scales directly with the value your users receive. Here is how to build the infrastructure for it.

## 1. Metering: The Heart of the System

You need a way to 'Count' every billable action (e.g., an email sent, a GB stored, an API call made). 
**The Architecture**:
1. When the action happens, emit an event to a **Kafka or Redis Queue**.
2. A small, high-throughput **Metering Service** picks up the event and increments the usage count for that tenant.

## 2. Reporting to the Billing Provider

Don't send an API call to Stripe on every use. It's too slow and expensive. Instead, use an **Aggregation Strategy**. Every hour/day, batch the usage counts and send them to the billing provider's 'Usage Record' API.

## 3. Real-Time Usage Visibility

Usage-based pricing creates 'Bill Shock' if the user can't see how much they've spent. Your dashboard must show a real-time (or near-real-time) counter of the current month's usage. I store these counters in **Redis** for sub-millisecond read performance.

## 4. Overages and Hard Limits

What happens when a user's usage exceeds their pre-paid tier? 
- **Soft Limit**: Send a warning email.
- **Hard Limit**: Stop the service until they upgrade or add more credits.
This logic should live in a central **Policy service** that all other microservices check before performing a billable action.

## 5. Billing Period Complexity

Unlike flat sessions, usage resets every month. You must ensure that your metering service is perfectly synced with the user's **Billing Cycle**. If Company A's month starts on the 10th and Company B's starts on the 20th, your aggregation logic must handle this offset correctly.

## Conclusion

Usage-based billing is an engineering and a product shift. It requires a more robust data pipeline than flat billing, but it creates a fairer, more scalable business model that aligns your success with your customers' success.
