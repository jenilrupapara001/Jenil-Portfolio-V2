## Introduction

Next.js 15 represents a paradigm shift in how we build React applications. It moves beyond simple static site generation to a hybrid model where the server and client work in perfect harmony.

In this guide, we will explore the core features that make Next.js 15 the default choice for modern web development.

## 1. Server Actions: The Death of the API Route?

Traditionally, handling form submissions required creating a separate API route (`/api/submit`). With Server Actions, you can invoke server-side code directly from your components.

```tsx
// actions.ts
'use server'

export async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  const title = formData.get('title')
  await db.post.create({ data: { title } })
}
```

This reduces the need for boilerplate API endpoints and keeps related logic co-located.

## 2. Partial Prerendering (PPR)

PPR is the holy grail of rendering strategies. it allows you to combine the speed of Static Generation with the dynamism of Server Side Rendering in a single page.

*   **Static Shell**: The layout and navigation are pre-built at build time.
*   **Dynamic Holes**: Personalized content (like a user profile) is streamed in when ready.

This results in an instant Initial Paint while dynamic data loads in parallel.

## 3. The New Compiler

Next.js 15 introduces a Rust-based compiler that is:
*   **7x faster** local server startup
*   **4x faster** hot module replacement (HMR)

This effectively eliminates the "waiting for localhost" fatigue that plagues large JavaScript codebases.

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 is not just an update; it is a maturation of the React ecosystem. By embracing Server Components and Actions, we can build faster, simpler, and more secure applications with less code.
