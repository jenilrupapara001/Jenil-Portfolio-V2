## The Public Endpoint Problem

Every API endpoint you expose is a surface for attack. Whether it's a competitor scraping your data or a botnet trying to crash your servers, you must have a "Shield" in place. 

## 1. Multi-Layer Rate Limiting

Rate limiting shouldn't just be one numbers. I implement three layers:
- **Application Level**: Using Redis to limit requests per `userId`.
- **Infrastructure Level**: Using Cloudflare or AWS WAF to drop requests from suspicious IPs before they even hit my servers.
- **Cost-Based Limiting**: Limiting expensive operations (like AI generation or heavy DB reports) more strictly than simple `GET` requests.

## 2. The Cloudflare / WAF Shield

A **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** is your first line of defense. It can automatically block known malicious bots, protect against SQL injection, and mitigate Large-scale DDoS attacks that would otherwise overwhelm your bandwidth.

## 3. Bot Detection and CAPTCHAs

For sensitive endpoints (like Login or Password Reset), rate limiting isn't enough. Use **Turnstile or reCAPTCHA v3**. These tools analyze user behavior (mouse movements, browser fingerprints) to block bots without annoying real users with "Select the Traffic Lights" puzzles.

## 4. API Keys and Whitelisting

If your API is for B2B partners, don't use open endpoints. Issue **API Keys** and, if possible, **Whitelist their static IPs**. This ensures that even if a key is leaked, it can't be used from a random hacker's machine.

## 5. Monitoring for Abnormal Behavior

Use **Anomaly Detection**. If a user typically makes 10 requests a day and suddenly makes 10,000, your system should automatically 'Shadow Ban' them and alert your security team. Observability is the key to proactive defense.

## Conclusion

Defending an API is a game of economics. Your goal is to make it so expensive and difficult for an attacker to abuse your system that they simply move on to an easier target.
